The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the provided parameters are not correctly formatted, for example, if you pass an object where a string is expected or vice versa. This can be challenging to debug since error messages are not always explicit. For instance, when dealing with database operations, a malformed query can result in an unexpected error.   Another issue is the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations. Forgetting to handle asynchronous calls properly, specifically using `.then()` and `.catch()` blocks for promises, can lead to silent failures or unexpected behavior.
